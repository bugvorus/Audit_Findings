### Missing address validation check in `EmethTokenInnovation.sol` contract.

**Description:** The `EmethTokenInnovation.sol` contract lacks essential zero address checks in critical functions, such as the constructor and when setting the `previousTokenContract` variable. It is noteworthy that an incorrect configuration of the `previousTokenContract` may render it unchangeable later. Additionally, function like `mint()` is missing these necessary checks. While the presence of the `onlyMinter` modifier helps control access, the absence of zero address checks, especially in the constructor, introduces the risk of unforeseen and undesirable behavior. 

**Impact:** Missing zero address check in function can leads to unexpected behaviour.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Make sure to use the check appropriately, especially in important functions where the configured value cannot not be altered once set.

```diff
constructor(address _previousTokenContract) {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    owners[msg.sender] = true;
    minters[msg.sender] = true;
+    require(_previousTokenContract != address(0), "EmethToken: _previousTokenContract cannot be zero address");
    previousTokenContract = _previousTokenContract; 
  }


function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyMinter returns (bool) {
    require(!paused, "EmethToken: the contract is paused");
+   require(_to != address(0), "EmethToken: Token recipient cannot be zero address")
    balances[_to] = balances[_to] + _amount;
    totalSupply = totalSupply + _amount;
    emit Transfer(address(0), _to, _amount);
    return true;
  }

```
