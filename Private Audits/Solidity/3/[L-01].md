### Missing zero address check in `CharacterNFT::mintToAccount`, `NFTOperation::exportToAccount`, and `MSMOperation::transferToAccount` function can leads to burning of token.

**Description:** In `CharacterNFT::mintToAccount` function, the protocol is minting a new token or NFT to an address. However, they are missing the zero address check prior to minting, which if not checked can lead to minting token to `address(0)` which burns the token. Causing the gas and resources wastage.
And in `NFTOperation::exportToAccount` and `MSMOperation::transferToAccount` functions, the owner send NFT to an address. However both of these functions lacks zero address check which can potentially leads to unexpected behaviour.

**Impact:** Missing address check can potentially leads minting to `address(0)`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement zero address check prior in above functions.

Use the followin code in `CharacterNFT::mintToAccount` function:

```diff
function mintToAccount(address account) public payable onlyOwner { 
+        require(account != address(0), "Token cannot be minted to address(0)");
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        require(!paused, "NFTs under maintenance!");
        require(supply <= maxSupply, "Sorry, all NFTs have been minted!");
        _safeMint(account, supply + 1);

        minted.push(
            NFTInfo(
                supply + 1, 
                msg.sender,
                toImage(supply + 1),
                block.timestamp
            )
        );
}

```
Use the followin code in `NFTOperation::exportToAccount` function:

```diff
function exportToAccount(
        address account,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
+       require(account != address(0), "Token cannot be transferred to address(0)");
        IERC721(characterNFTAddress).transferFrom(  
            address(this),
            account, 
            tokenId
        );

        emit CharacterExportEvent(tokenId, account);
    }

```

Use the followin code in `MSMOperation::transferToAccount` function:

```diff
function transferToAccount(
        address account,
        uint256 amount
    ) public onlyOwner nonReentrant { 
+       require(account != address(0), "Token cannot be transferred to address(0)");
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(msmToken), account, amount);
    }
```
