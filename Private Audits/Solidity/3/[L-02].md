### The `NFTOperation::exportToAccount` function should use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` to avoid potentially loss of token.

**Description:** The `NFTOperation::exportToAccount` function is used to transfer the token to an address `account` using the token's id as parameters. However, if the receiver is a smart contract which is not ready to receive the token then the  `account` can potentially permanently loss the token.

**Impact:** Receiver can potentially loss the token.

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:** Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` :

```diff
function exportToAccount(
        address account,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
-        IERC721(characterNFTAddress).transferFrom 
+        IERC721(characterNFTAddress).safeTransferFrom(  
            address(this),
            account, 
            tokenId
        );

        emit CharacterExportEvent(tokenId, account);
    }

```
