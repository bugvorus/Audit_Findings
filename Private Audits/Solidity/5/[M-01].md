### Excess ether sent by the user in `RNSId::authorizeMint` function locks in the contract forever.

**Description:** The function `authorizeMint` in the `RNSId` contract is meant to charge users a fee for minting tokens. Currently, the function requires the amount sent by the user to be at least equal to the fee `require(msg.value >= fee, "insufficient fund");`. However, there's no mechanism in place to handle cases where users accidentally send more than the fee. This problem might arise because the minting price isn't fixed and could change in the future, leading users to overpay.
As a result, users risk having their excess funds stuck in the contract indefinitely, causing unnecessary worry. Implementing a solution for this issue would improve user experience with the contract and prevent funds from being trapped.

**Impact:** Users end up losing their funds if they transfer excess amount than `fee` to the `authorizeMint` function. 

**Recommended Mitigation:** We recommend to implement the following code. We use `pull over push` payment system to make this functionality much secure. And consider an event emission whenever the minting price changes.

```diff
+    mapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;
+    event UpdatedMintPrice(uint256 newMintPrice);
.
.
    function setMintPrice( uint256 _mintPrice) external onlyRole(SECONDARY_ADMIN_ROLE) { 
        mintPrice = _mintPrice;
+        emit UpdatedMintPrice(mintPrice);
    }
.
.
    function authorizeMint(string memory _rnsId, address _wallet) external payable nonReentrant {
        string memory idAddressKey = getIdentityKey(_rnsId, _wallet);
        require(isAuthorized[idAddressKey], "not authorized an ID for the address");
        require(!isBlockedAddress[_wallet], "the wallet is blacklisted");
        require(!isBlockedRnsID[_rnsId], "the RNS ID is blacklisted");
        uint256 fee = mintPrice;
        uint256 numMintedForID = numMinted[_rnsId];
        if (hasRole(SECONDARY_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            fee = 0;
        }
        require(msg.value >= fee, "insufficient fund");
+       uint256 amount = msg.value;
+       uint256 excessAmount = amount.sub(fee);
+       if(excessAmount > 0) {
+           pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = excessAmount;
+       } 
        numMinted[_rnsId] = numMintedForID.add(1);
        isAuthorized[idAddressKey] = true;
        emit RNSAddressAuthorized(_rnsId, _wallet); // Kept the event emission
    }

+   function withdrawExcess() external nonReentrant {
+        uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];
+        require(amount > 0, "No excess funds available for withdrawal");

+        pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;
+        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
+    }
```
