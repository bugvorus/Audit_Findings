### The `RNSId` contract should explicitly check for the ERC165Upgradeable interface in `RNSId::supportsInterface` function.

**Description:** The `supportsInterface` function checks for ` ERC721Upgradeable`, `ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable`, and `AccessControlUpgradeable` interfaces compatibility. But does not inclue `ERC165Upgradeable` in checks. Interface IDs are calculating by XORing together all the function signatures in the interface. Therefore, returning true for other interface Ids does not guarantee the contract compatibility with `ERC165Upgradeable` contract.

**Impact:** The absence of an explicit check for the `ERC165Upgradeable` interface ID does not explicitly tells the contract compatibility with ERC165Upgradeable standards.

**Recommended Mitigation:** We recommend the following changes in `supportsInterface` function:

```diff
function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 _interfaceId
    )
        public
        view
        override(
+           ERC165Upgradeable,
            ERC721Upgradeable,
            ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable,
            AccessControlUpgradeable
        )
        returns (bool)
    {   
        return super.supportsInterface(_interfaceId);
    }

```
