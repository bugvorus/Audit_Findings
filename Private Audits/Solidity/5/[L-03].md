### Anyone can set the greeting in `Greeter.sol` file by calling `setGreeting` function.

**Description:** The primary purpose of the `Greeter` contract is to facilitate the setting and viewing of a greeting message. The `setGreeting` function, although public and unrestricted, allows any caller to modify the greeting message. While this may not directly affect the core functionality of the protocol, the absence of comprehensive documentation using Natspec and considering that the contract's sole purpose revolves around this functionality, we assess this as Low.

**Impact:** A malicious user can set the uncomfortable message as greeting for users.

**Recommended Mitigation:** We recommend the following changes:

```diff
contract Greeter {
    string private greeting;
+   address private owner;

+   event GreetingChanged(string newGreeting);

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        console.log("Deploying a Greeter with greeting:", _greeting);
        greeting = _greeting;
+        owner = msg.sender; // Set contract deployer as owner
    }

+   function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) external {
+       require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change the greeting");
+       require(bytes(_greeting).length > 0, "Greeting should not be empty");
        console.log("Changing greeting from '%s' to '%s'", greeting, _greeting);
+       emit GreetingChanged(_greeting);
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}

```
