### The `RNSId` contract lacks `disableInitializers` call to protect unintialized contract from attackers.

**Description:**  The `RNSId` contract is using the Initializable module from OpenZeppelin. To prevent leaving an implementation contract uninitialized OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation recommends adding the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor to lock the contracts automatically when they are deployed. 
This function disables the initializer functionality, ensuring that initializers are not inadvertently called during contract deployment or upgrade.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider calling the `_disableInitializers` function in `RNSId` contract's constructor:

```diff
+    constructor() {
+        _disableInitializers();
+    }

```
