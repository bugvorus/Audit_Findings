###  Error-prone typecasting in `RNSId::getIdentityKey` function can leads to unexpected behaviour 

**Description:** The `getIdentityKey` function in the provided code uses `abi.encodePacked` to concatenate the `_rnsId` string and the `_wallet` address. However, the way it handles the concatenation of the address raises some concerns.
The function first converts the `_wallet` address to a byte array using `abi.encodePacked(_wallet)`. It then implicitly typecasts this byte array to a string using `string(abi.encodePacked(_wallet))` before concatenating it with the `_rnsId` string.

While this approach works, it relies on an implicit typecasting operation, which can potentially lead to unexpected or incorrect string representation, which may lead to errors or unintended behavior if the input `_wallet` address is invalid or contains non-hexadecimal characters.
When converting an Ethereum address to a string representation, it's crucial to ensure that the resulting string is a valid hexadecimal string representation of the address. This is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing potential issues when working with addresses in various contexts.

**Impact:** The typcasting operation can potentially lead to unexpected or incorrect string representation, which may lead to errors or unintended behavior

**Recommended Mitigation:** We recommend to implement the following changes:

```diff
+   import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/StringsUpgradeable.sol";
.
.
    function getIdentityKey(string memory _rnsId, address _wallet) internal pure returns (string memory) {
+       require(_wallet != address(0), "Invalid wallet address");
+       string memory walletString = StringsUpgradeable.toHexString(_wallet);
 
-       return  string(abi.encodePacked(_rnsId, string(abi.encodePacked(_wallet))));
+       return  string(abi.encodePacked(_rnsId, walletString));;
    }

```
