In this section, I have assigned a unique number to each `client` instead of using their `name`, and the severity of each finding is labeled using its first letter.

For example, if for client 'UIERGJG' I identify 1 critical and 3 high-severity issues, the client is assigned a number based on their position in the list (for this explanation, let's assume it is 4).

=>The findings are then presented under 4 as [C-01], [H-01], [H-02], [H-03], and so on.
