In this section, I have assigned a number to each client instead of using their name, and the severity of each finding is labeled by its first letter.  
For instance, if for client 'HIODS' I identify 1 critical and 3 high-severity issues, the client will be assigned a number based on their position in the list (in this case, 1). 
The findings will then be rendered as 1(C), 1(H.1), 1(H.2), and 1(H.3) and so on.
