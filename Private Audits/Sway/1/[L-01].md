### Fee Amount Validation

**Description:** There is no proper validation for zero fee amounts before transfer

```javascript
let fee_amount = (eth_amount * fee_percent) /100;
transfer(fee_receiver, AssetId::base(), fee_amount);
transfer(msg_sender().unwrap(), asset_id, amount_out);

```

**Impact:** The code may attempt to transfer zero fees to the receiver, which could be a logical error.

**Recommended Mitigation:** We recommend to implement following check for protection

```javascript
if fee_amount>0 {
    //proceed with fee transfer
}
```
