### Missing Zero Address Check in Withdraw Function

**Description:** The `withdraw` function does not validate the recipient address, potentially allowing transfers to the zero address.

```javascript
.
.
#[storage{read, write)]
fn withdraw_assets_from_pool(pool_asset: AssetId, to: Identity){
.
.
```

**Impact:**  This could result in permanent loss of funds if assets are transferred to the zero address.

**Recommended Mitigation:** We recommend to implement the following check to avoid this

```javascript
fn withdraw(to: Address, amount: u64) {
  require(to != Address::from(zero), "Cannot withdraw to zero address");
  // rest of the function body

}
```
