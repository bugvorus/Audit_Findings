### Uncapped Fee Percentage

**Description:** The fee percentage only checks for values less than or equal to 100 but lacks a reasonable upper limit.
This could potentially allow the system to charge users a 100% fee, resulting in users being unable to
withdraw funds. The absence of a defined upper limit may lead to centralization and power
concentration among those who can afford high fees, creating additional security risks. It is crucial for
the system to properly define an upper limit on fees to protect user funds and maintain trust in the
contract.

```javascript
.
.
require(cfg.fee_percent <= 100, "fee-percent-cannot-exceed-100");
storage.cfg.write(cfg);
initialize_ownership(owner);
.
```

**Impact:** Protocol can charge 100% of user funds as fees

**Recommended Mitigation:**
We recommend the following check as recommendation

```javascript
require(cfg.fee_percent <=30, "Fee percentage cannot exceed 30");
```
