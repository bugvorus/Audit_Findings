### Asset Reserves Update Mechanism

**Description:** The `remain_asset_reserves` function lacks a proper update mechanism. Once the contract is live, it
cannot adjust or update funds, which may lead to significant calculation errors and operational impacts.
Impact: Inaccurate reserve tracking over time could compromise the integrity of the protocol.

```javascript
.
.
remain_asset_reserves: 0
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

1. Implement a proper update function for reserve
2. Add validation checks for reserve updates
