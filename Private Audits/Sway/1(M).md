### Unused function parameters can lead to false assumptions on user side

The units parameter in `mintClaimWithFractions` is used only in the event emission. This is misleading because
 `fractions.length` number of fractions will be minted. If `units != fractions.length` this can
have unexpected consequences for a user. The same is the problem with the `account` parameter in both
`mintClaim` and `mintClaimWithFractions` - it is not used in the method and actually `msg.sender` is the
account to which tokens are minted and is set as the token creator. Again if `account != msg.sender` this is
unexpected from a user standpoint and while in the best case scenario leads to a not so great UX, in the worst
case it can lead to faulty assumptions for value received by the account address.

### Recommendations
Remove the `units` parameter from `mintClaimWithFractions` and also use `account` instead of `msg.sender`
in the `_mintValue` call in `mintClaim` and `mintClaimWithFractions`.
